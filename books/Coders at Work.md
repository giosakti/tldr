Joshua Bloch
- Readibility is very important!
  - "Oh it's not worth the time; it's just the name of a variable"
    - "You're not going to produce a maintainable program with that altitude"
  - Easier to optimize correct code than to correct optimized code
- API design
  - "Many customers won't tell you a problem; they'll tell you a solution"
  - Don't create a lot of spec before you know it's gonna be used by your users
- Programmers time are sometimes more important than CPU time
